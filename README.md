 Public API Requests

*Project*
so we have to fetch 12 random users from API , and display them on the page along with a modul appear when clicking each user and adding next and previous buttons to be able to move between users. 

I have to say This project had nothing new for me as I have been through it before , and I have styled everything myself here , this is all my code , and as you can see I have used sass for styling(not in a very professional way ,but working my way through it ^^) , but working with API is really cool thing to do . 

*Changes*
-changed the background color 
-used fonts (sass/utilities/_variable.scss)
-added hover and color changing of user's backgrounds
-the next and previous buttons appears as iconic buttons and also added some color styling among with hover on them.
-a search tab where you can search users by the letter in their first names or last names or both.
